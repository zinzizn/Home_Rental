      By using or accessing HomeAway.com, Vrbo.com, VacationRentals.com, a subdomain of any such websites, any mobile application for such websites or any other website operated by us on which these Terms and Conditions are posted via a link or otherwise (each referred to herein as a “Site”), you acknowledge and agree that you are subject to the following terms and conditions, as well as our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Site, and is incorporated by reference (These Terms and Conditions with the Privacy Policy shall be referred to as the “Terms“). Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than court.

      A user’s reservation or use of a HomeAway site is bound by the terms and conditions on the HomeAway site where the reservation is finalized (and not necessarily the HomeAway site on which the property was originally listed). If there are any conflicts between the terms and conditions of the HomeAway site you found the property on and the terms and conditions of the HomeAway site you finalize a booking on, the terms and conditions of the HomeAway site where the reservation is finalized will govern. If you do not fully agree to these Terms and any other terms and conditions posted or linked to any Site, you are not authorized to access or otherwise use the Site. Under these Terms, “use“ or “access“ of the Site specifically includes any direct or indirect access or use of the Site or any cached version of the Site and any direct or indirect access or use of any information or content on the Site, regardless of how obtained and the term “Site“ includes, without limitation, any cached version thereof.

  <h2 class="privacy-heading">2. Service Fee Payable by Travelers and choice of currency.</h2>
  <div class="privacy-quote">
  <p class="privacy-description">
    We charge a service fee payable by travelers who book a property on the Site via the Site checkout. The service fee covers the use of the Site, including such features as 24/7 user support, and is calculated as a variable percentage of the total reservation amount (which may or may not include additional fees, taxes and damage deposits). Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction of the traveler and/or member, VAT may be charged on top of the service fee. The exact service fee (and any VAT, if applicable) charged will be displayed to travelers at the time of booking. The service fee plus applicable VAT will be charged after both the traveler and member accept the reservation. The service fee will only be refunded in the event a traveler is entitled to a refund of the entire rental amount under the terms of the cancellation policy presented in the listing. Any taxes alleged to be owed by any taxing authority on the service fee are the responsibility of HomeAway and members have no responsibility for any such claimed tax liability. Members agree not to encourage or advise a traveler to avoid or circumvent the service fee charged by HomeAway.

  <p class="privacy-description">
    Vrbo allows travelers to display prices on the Site in the currency of their choice and may also allow travelers to pay in the currency of their choice. Different currency choices are generally based on publicly available currency rates and are not guaranteed to be the best rate available. If your currency of choice is not supported for a booking, you’ll be charged in the owner’s selected currency. In any event, the currency and exact amount you will pay will be displayed clearly at check out. Our overall compensation may be affected by the currency you choose to pay in. Note that if you pay in a currency different than the currency of your card, your bank or card provider may charge you foreign exchange, transaction, or other fees.
